# üõ†Ô∏è Pre-installation

## üìå Create bootable media with the OS image

To download Arch Linux, head to https://archlinux.org/download/ and download the latest release
(~800MB). Once downloaded you need to put the image on a USB, you can use different tools on 
MacOS and Windows, like Balena Etcher, WonderISO, Fedora Media Writer, etc. Choose one and 
proceed.

From your UEFI screen disable secure boot (we can re-enable it later). On some systems secure 
boot could disallow Arch Linux to boot properly. If you are creating a dual boot system (e.g.
Windows + Linux) it is important to disable fast startup and hibernation features on Windows.


## üìå Boot from installation medium

Plug the USB, turn on the machine and access the BIOS firmware UI (it is done in different ways 
depending on the specific hardware configuration). From there pick the bootable USB drive as 
the device to boot from. The installation process will ask you confirmation for OS 
installation, proceed and wait the Arch Linux installer to boot. If everything works as 
expected you should see the terminal in a screen like the one showed below. The Arch installer
doesn't have any graphical user interface to automate the installation.

Make sure that you've booted in UEFI mode and not in BIOS mode. The following command will 
output a bunch of UEFI related files if the boot started in UEFI mode properly. In case of a 
BIOS boot, the _efi_ directory won't even exist inside the `/sys/firmware` directory.

````shell
$ ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
````

By default, the console assumes that you have a standard US keyboard layout. You can change 
the layout to a different one. All the available keymaps are usually kept inside the 
`/usr/share/kbd/keymaps` directory in the form of map.gz files.
```shell
$ ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz
```

Choose the keyboard layout you prefer, load it and save the change with the `loadkeys` command.
```shell
# <layout> is the name of a layout found in/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz
# without the map.gz extension
$ loadkeys <layout> 
```

### Network connection
Before proceeding, we must connect to internet in our USB installation environment.

If you're using a wired network you could have a working internet connection already working. 
To test it out, ping any public addresses. If you have a wireless connection you have to 
configure it manually. The live environment comes with the iwd or iNet wireless daemon 
package. You can use this package to connect to a nearby wireless network.

```shell
# starts an interactive CLI
$ iwctl 
  # list wifi cards/devices in your machine (e.g. wlan0)
  > device list
  # scan wifi networks using that wifi card
  > station <device> scan
  > station <device> get-networks
  # connect to the network you choose, the 
  # CLI should ask you for credentials
  > station <device> connect <SSID>
  # if all good, exit from the CLI
  > exit
  
# check everything works correctly
$ ping 8.8.8.8
```

Finally sync the machine clock using the NTP time protocol:
```shell
$ timedatectl set-ntp true
```

## üìå Disk partitioning
Disk partitioning is dangerous if you don't know what you are doing, if you mess up your 
partitions, you lose data on your disks. So keep attention!

Start with `lsblk` or `fdisk` to obtain information about the current disks and partitioning. 
We will go with the second option. List the partition tables for all the available devices on 
your computer. Ignore any device not related to physical disks and consider only those (should 
be named like e.g. _/dev/sda_, _/dev/nvme0n1_, etc. depending on your hardware). Remember: 
these files under _/dev_ represent devices/pieces of hardware connected to your machine and
exposed as block files (block for disks).

```shell
$ fdisk -l
```

Choose a disk to install the OS, take note of the corresponding block file under /dev and 
inspect the disk and its partitions. The command will output the partition table for the 
device. Partitions are usually named after the name of the disk, so if you have _/dev/nvme0n1_ 
as a disk name, partitions are named _/dev/nvme0n1p1_, _/dev/nvme0n1p2_, etc.

```shell
$ fdisk </path/to/your/device/file> -l
```

Once you collect all useful information, use `gdisk` to start re-partitioning the disk (`gdisk`
is the user-friendly version of `fdisk`, it uses an interactive CLI). You really want to have 
a GPT partitioned disk, MBR is considered legacy and must be avoided.

You need at least three partitions to install Arch Linux:

| Partition            | Usage                                                       | Space   | Type             | Filesystem to use | Temporary mount point                   |
|:---------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:--------|:-----------------|:------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| EFI system partition | used to store files required by the UEFI firmware           | 500MB   | EFI              | FAT32             | /mnt                                    |
| ROOT partition       | for installing the distribution itself and store user files | > 100GB | Linux filesystem | EXT4              | /mnt/boot                               |
| SWAP partition       | space dedicated for swapping (overflow space for your RAM)  | 10GB    | Linux swap       |                   | -                                       |

Note that if you are creating a dual boot setup some partitions could be already present. You 
don't want to touch partitions dedicated to other OS. Also note that in this case the EFI 
partitions is already present since it's shared between multiple installed OS. Don't touch
that, just create the other partitions and move on.

```shell
# start the gdisk CLI
$ gdisk </path/to/your/device/file>
  ### GDISK COMMANDS 
  # show help and commands
  > ?
  # list current partitions on disk
  > p 
  # create new partition, it will ask first and last sector so the
  # size of the partition will be (last sector - first sector)
  # OR you can input the first sector and the size directly as the 
  # last sector field e.g. +100G
  > n
  # show type of partitions, then choose appropriate value
  # (EFI type, Linux filesystem, etc)
  > l
  # confirm partitions creation and exit
  > w
  
  ### PARTITIONS CREATION
  # create EFI partition, size = +500M, type code = ef00 
  > n 
  # create ROOT partition, size = +100G, type code = 8300 
  > n 
  # create EFI partition, size = +10G, type code = 8200 
  > n
  # check everything is correct, then write and exit 
  > p
  > w
```

After writing the partitions check again everything worked as expected. Take note of the 
partition device names (e.g. _/dev/nvme0n1p1_, _/dev/nvme0n1p2_, etc.), you must refer to them 
in the next step.

```shell
$ fdisk /dev/sda -l
```

## üìåÔ∏è Filesystems and mount points

Partitioning by itself is not enough for the OS to use the partitions. We need to format the 
partitions. To do this we must create a filesystem on each partition. A file system is a 
standard that defined how files and data are stored and organized on disk. The most popular 
Linux filesystems are _ext3_ and _ext4_. The filesystem is a feature of a partition, recorded
along with the partitions themselves in the partition table, therefore they are used to
indicate how to interpret/manage partitions to the OS.

The EFI partition should be formatted with a FAT32 filesystem. It is a standard for EFI 
partitions and all OS rely on this to read the EFI partition.

```shell
# format the EFI partition with a FAT32 filesystem
# <path/to/the/partition/device> is not the disk itself (/dev/nvme0n1), but
# the device file referring to the EFI partition (e.g. /dev/nvme0n1p1)
$ mkfs.fat -F32 <path/to/the/EFI_partition/file>

# format the ROOT partition with a EXT4 filesystem
$ mkfs.ext4 <path/to/the/ROOT_partition/file>

# format the SWAP partition
$ mkswap <path/to/the/SWAP_partition/file>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è TO CHECK ‚ö†Ô∏è 
Note that now we are operating inside the Arch Linux Live Environment and the filesystem rooted 
at `/` contains the files loaded from the USB installation medium. This filesystem is not really 
backed by the USB storage, but is simulated on the RAM (this is how live installations works). 
Writing/modifying files in the current filesystem will not result in permanent modifications 
of the USB contents. So the files we can visualize (until the end of the current installation 
step) are files of an Arch Linux system, but in RAM and loaded from the USB Live image. ‚ö†Ô∏è

We need now to mount our disk partitions on the filesystem, following the table below. The 
`/mnt` directory is generally used for temporary mounts so it's fine to use it now. Note that 
in the final installation ROOT and EFI partitions will be mounted on proper locations.

| Partition            | Filesystem     | Temporary mount point | 
|:---------------------|:---------------|:----------------------|
| ROOT partition       | EXT4           | /mnt                  |
| EFI system partition | FAT32          | /mnt/boot             |
| SWAP partition       | -              | -                     |


```shell
# mount the ROOT partition on the file system
$ mount --mkdir /dev/<ROOT_partition_file> /mnt

# mount the EFI partition on the file system
$ mount --mkdir /dev/<EFI_partition_file> /mnt/boot

# don't mount the SWAP partition, just tell Linux to use it
$ swapon /dev/<SWAP_partition_file>
```

## üìå Configure mirror servers

At this point we have some partitions on one or more disks, properly formatted and temporarily 
mounted. We need now to configure the mirrors to download Arch Linux packages. The installer
comes with `reflector`, a script able to retrieve the latest mirror list from the Arch Linux
Mirror Status page.

Reflector can generate a list of mirrors based on a set of requirements. In this case, I want 
a list of mirrors that were synchronized within the last 12 hours and that are located in 
Italy (you should use your country), and sort the mirrors by download speed. The save command 
will persist the result in the specified file. You can run the reflector without saving the 
output just to see what the script produces (the list of mirrors).

The file at `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` is a configuration file used by pacman to know which 
mirrors to use (in descending order of preference). Now when we'll install Arch Linux in the 
next steps, the OS and all packages will be downloaded from the mirrors indicated there.

```bash
$ reflector \
  --download-timeout 60 \
  --country Italy \
  --age 12 \
  --protocol https \
  --sort rate \
  --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
