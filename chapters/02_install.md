## üõ†Ô∏è Install OS

First of all let's update packages of the Live OS.

```shell
$ pacman -Sy
```

Once the update process is finished, you can use the `pacstrap` script to install the Arch 
Linux system. The `pacstrap` script can install packages to a specified new root directory 
(`/mnt`). As you may remember, the root partition was mounted on the `/mnt`mount point, so 
that's what you'll use with this script.

```shell
$ pacstrap /mnt \ 
    # the linux kernel and most
    # common linux firmwares
    linux \
    linux-firmware \  
    # minimal package set to define a 
    # basic Arch Linux installation
    base \
    # linux utilities and some useful 
    # linux tools and commands
    sudo \         
    networkmanager
    # C compiler & dev utilities
    gcc \
    git \
    make \
    vim \
    docker \

```

Now the Linux kernel is installed along with some utilities (in the temporary mounted disk
partition), but it's not enough. We need to configure some more things to have a proper 
running system.

### Configure partitions mounts at boot

We manually mounted partitions into the file system, but these mounts are not yet permanent.
The `/mnt/etc/fstab` file can be used to define how disk partitions, various other block
devices, or remote file systems should be mounted into the file system at boot.

The `genstab` script simply detects all the current mounts below a given mount point and
prints them in fstab-compatible format to standard output. We can redirect the output to 
the `/mnt/etc/fstab` file, so the OS will re-mount all the partitions at boot.

```shell
$ genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

Double-check the `/mnt/etc/fstab` file. If everything looks good, we can proceed.

### üìù Change root to new root partition 

From here, it is convenient to change root inside the new root partitions (where the new OS
is installed) and run the commands inside the chroot (called also _root jail_).

A `chroot` on Unix and Unix-like operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent
root directory for the current running process and its children. A program that is run in such
a modified environment cannot name (and therefore normally cannot access) files outside the
designated directory tree. The term _chroot_ may refer to the _chroot system call_ or the
_chroot wrapper program_. The modified environment is called a _chroot jail_.

```shell
$ arch-chroot /mnt
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Install the boot loader (GRUB)

### Introduction

A short recap of the boot process under UEFI before installing the GRUB boot loader. Below
there's the output of the `efibootmgr` command. It shows the boot entries saved in the machine
NVRAM (where boot entries are stored in hardware).

```shell
$ efibootmgr -v
  BootCurrent: 0002
  Timeout: 3 seconds
  BootOrder: 0003,0002,0000,0004        # order in which the entries in the list will be tried.
  Boot0000* CD/DVD Drive  BIOS(3,0,00)
  Boot0001* Hard Drive    HD(2,0,00)
  Boot0002* Fedora        HD(1,800,61800,6d98f360-cb3e-4727-8fed-5ce0c040365d)File(\EFI\fedora\grubx64.efi)
  Boot0003* opensuse      HD(1,800,61800,6d98f360-cb3e-4727-8fed-5ce0c040365d)File(\EFI\opensuse\grubx64.efi)
  Boot0004* Hard Drive    BIOS(2,0,00)P0: ST1500DM003-9YN16G
```

Under the UEFI firmware, the boot process looks like this:
- the system is switched on, the power-on self-test (POST) is executed
- after POST, the UEFI firmware initializes the hardware required for booting (disk,
  keyboard, etc.)
- the firmware reads the boot entries in the NVRAM to determine which EFI application are
  present and which to launch and from where (from which disk and partition)
- boot entries can be of one of this type:

  - _simply a disk (BIOS compatibility)_: BIOS compatible booting mechanism, in the example
    below boot entries 0000 and 0004

  - _fallback UEFI boot entries_: for those, the firmware will look through each EFI system
    partition on the disk in the order they exist on the disk. Within the ESP, it will look
    for a file with a specific name and location. Example: on an x86-64 PC, it will look for
    the file `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTx64.EFI`. This mechanism is not designed for booting permanently
    installed OSes. It's more designed for booting hot-pluggable, device-agnostic media, like
    live images and OS install media. In the example below boot entry 0001

  - _full UEFI native boot entries_: typical entries for operating systems permanently
    installed to permanent storage devices. These entries show us the full power of the UEFI
    boot mechanism, by not just saying "boot from this disk", but "boot this specific
    bootloader in this specific location on this specific disk". In the example below boot
    entries 0002 and 0003

- the firmware launches the EFI application: this could be a boot loader or the Arch kernel
  itself using EFISTUB, it could be some other EFI application such as the UEFI shell or a
  boot manager like systemd-boot or rEFInd.


The UEFI native mechanism is the one to preferably adopt when installing a OS. Operating
systems should make themselves available for booting in this way: the OS is intended to
install a bootloader which loads the OS kernel, in an EFI system partition, and add an entry
to the UEFI boot manager configuration with a proper name and the location of the bootloader
(in EFI executable format) that is could be used to load that operating system.

### Update CPU microcode

üìùÔ∏è Inside the _chroot_ at the mount point of the root partition (`/mnt/`).

Processors may have faulty behaviour, which the kernel can correct by updating the microcode
on startup. Processor manufacturers release stability and security updates to the processor
microcode. These updates provide bug fixes that can be critical to the stability of your system.

```shell
# for amd processors
$ pacman -S amd-ucode
# for intel processors
$ pacman -S intel-ucode
```

### Installation

üìùÔ∏è Inside the _chroot_ at the mount point of the root partition (`/mnt/`).

Let's proceed with the installation. First, install the packages `grub` and `efibootmgr`:
GRUB is the bootloader itself while `efibootmgr` is used by the GRUB installation script
(or by us) to write boot entries to NVRAM.

```shell
$ pacman -S grub efibootmgr
```

We need to mount the EFI partition (if not already mounted previously) on `/mnt/boot` if we
are outside the _chroot_ or `/boot` if we are inside or we already logged in the newly
created OS (somehow). The following commands assume we are inside the _chroot_. If for some
reason it is necessary to run grub-install from outside of the installed system, append the
_--boot-directory=_ option with the path to the mounted _/boot_ directory, e.g
_--boot-directory=/mnt/boot_.

Remember to use the correct disk and partition here, since we need a specific filesystem type
(FAT32) to install the boot loader into.

After mounting the partition, execute the `grub-install` command to install the GRUB EFI
application _grubx64.efi_ to `${ESP}/EFI/GRUB/` and install its modules to
`${ESP}/grub/x86_64-efi/`.

```shell
# mount EFI partition if not already mounted
ESP="/boot"
$ mount --mkdir /dev/<efi_system_partition> ${ESP}

# install grub
$ grub-install \
    --target=x86_64-efi \
    --bootloader-id=arch-<your-name> \
    --efi-directory=${ESP}
```

The `grub-install` command also tries to create an entry in the firmware boot manager, named
`arch-<your-name>` in the above example. This can fail if your boot entries are full; use
`efibootmgr` to remove unnecessary entries.

Finally we generate configuration files for GRUB. Use the `grub-mkconfig` command to generate
the GRUB configuration file and saves it to a given target location. In this case
`/boot/grub/grub.cfg` is the target location.

```shell
$ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```










## üõ†Ô∏è OS configuration

### Configure time zone

üìùÔ∏è Inside the _chroot_ at the mount point of the root partition (`/mnt/`).

List the available timezones then choose the correct one creating a symbolic link.

```shell
$ ls -alh /usr/share/zoneinfo
$ ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/<region>/<city> /etc/localtime
$ hwclock --systohc # generate /etc/adjtime
```

### Configure languages

üìùÔ∏è Inside the _chroot_ at the mount point of the root partition (`/mnt/`).

First, you'll have to edit the `etc/locale.gen` file according to your localization. Open the 
file in a text editor and uncomment the locale you want to use. Then run the `locale-gen` 
command that will read your `/etc/locale.gen` file and generate the locales accordingly.

```shell
# uncomment languages chosen
$ vim /etc/locale.gen 
# generate and save locale files
$ locale-gen
```

Now that you've enabled multiple languages, you'll have to tell Arch Linux which one to use by 
default. To do so, open the `/etc/locale.conf` file and add the following line to it, modified
accordingly based on the language chosen.

```shell
$ touch /etc/locale.conf
$ echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf 
$ cat /etc/locale.conf
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

You can always go back to the `/etc/locale.gen` file and add or remove languages from it and 
run again `locale-gen`.

If you've made any changes to your console keymaps in the first step of installation, you may 
want to persist them now. To do so, open the `/etc/vconsole.conf` file and add your preferred 
keymaps there.

```shell
$ touch /etc/vconsole.conf
$ echo "KEYMAP=it" > /etc/vconsole.conf 
$ cat /etc/vconsole.conf
KEYMAP=it
```

### Configure basic networking

üìùÔ∏è Inside the _chroot_ at the mount point of the root partition (`/mnt/`).

I use the `networkmanager` package to handle connection, because it is easier to use 
and implements different functionalities in one place. Alternatively there are different
options. Personally I tried with `wpa_supplicant` + `dhcp_client` to connect to a wi-fi
access point and handle IP assignation via DHCP.

```shell
# install the package if not done previously
$ pacman -S networkmanager
# enable it as a systemd unit, and disable other 
# network related tools that could interfere
$ systemctl stop wpa_supplicant
$ systemctl disable wpa_supplicant
$ systemctl enable NetworkManager
```

We need also to configure the host name for this machine, modifying the `/etc/hostname` file.
I usually use my machine model + my name as my hostname. Additionally it's a good thing to 
modify the `/etc/hosts` file to provide some DNS records. 

```shell
$ cat /etc/hostname
andrea-<machine>

$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1        localhost
::1              localhost
127.0.1.1        andrea-<machine>
```

### Change root user password

üìùÔ∏è Inside the _chroot_ at the mount point of the root partition (`/mnt/`).

The passwd command lets you change the password for a user. By default it affects the current 
user's password which is the root right now. Do it and follow the prompt.

```shell
$ passwd
```

### Add non-root user

üìùÔ∏è Inside the _chroot_ at the mount point of the root partition (`/mnt/`).

The installation leaves by default only one user: the root superuser. Using your Linux system 
as the root user for long is not a good idea. So creating a non-root user is important. The 
`wheel` group is the administration group, commonly used to give privileges to perform 
administrative actions. Create a new user and change its password.

```shell
# -m = add corresponding home directory
# -G = add to indicated group 
$ useradd -m -G wheel <username>

# change password for newly created user
$ passwd <username>
```

If not already present add administration privileges for the new user. Open `/etc/sudoers` and 
uncomment the following line. 

```shell
$ vim /etc/sudoers
# uncomment this
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

## üõ†Ô∏è End
Congratulations, you now have a working Arch Linux installation. At this point, you can exit
the Arch-Chroot environment, unmount the partition, and reboot.
